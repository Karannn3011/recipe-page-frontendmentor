## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to change the color of bullets and numbers in lists. I also improved my understanding of writing semantic HTML to create better structured and more accessible code. Additionally, I learned the importance of proper nesting of elements to keep the code clean and organized. Finally, I gained more experience working with tables, including using table, tr, and td, and styling them effectively.

### Continued development

For my next steps, I want to dive deeper into building responsive layouts, as well as adding transitions and animations to make my projects more dynamic and interactive. I plan to focus on mastering responsive design principles, learning different types of transitions, and creating smooth, engaging animations to further improve my front-end skills.
